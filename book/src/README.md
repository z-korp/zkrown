By innovatively adapting an iconic game in this manner, we hope to highlight blockchain gaming benefits, energize a community of players, and define open source development standards. Our solution guarantees fair rules and randomness via blockchain properties. We aim to showcase our expertise in Starknet gaming as an ongoing resource for the ecosystem.
